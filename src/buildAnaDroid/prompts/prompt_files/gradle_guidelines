# General Guidelines for Resolving Android Build Errors  

When a build error occurs, follow these steps:  
1. Identify the error from the build logs.  
2. Match it against known error patterns listed below.  
3. Apply the appropriate fix using the provided commands.  
4. Retry the build and check if the issue is resolved.  

## 1. Missing Dependency Errors  
Error Message: Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':app:debugCompileClasspath'.
Fix: 
1. Ensure these two lines are in the `repositories` block:  
   ```
   allprojects {
       repositories {
           google() // NOTE: DO NOT ADD if gradle version is 5.4.1 or below
           mavenCentral() // Must add
       }
   }
   ```
2. Save the file and sync Gradle:  
   ```
   ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
   ```
## 1-2. Missing Dependency Errors (JitPack-based Libraries)
Error Message: Could not find net.opacapp:multiline-collapsingtoolbar:27.1.1
Fix:
1. Confirm whether the dependency version exists in public Maven repositories:
    ```
    curl -I https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/<group_path>/<artifact>/<version>/<artifact>-<version>.pom
    ```
If the result is `404`, it doesn't exist there.
2. If it's a GitHub-based library, switch to the JitPack-compatible Maven coordinates:
    ```
    implementation 'com.github.<user>:<repo>:+'
    ```
Use `+` as <tag>, which means use the **latest successfully built version** from GitHub.
3. In `build.gradle` (project-level) ensure JitPack is in the repositories:
    ```
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            google()
            mavenCentral()
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
    ```

## 2. Library Method Signature Error  
Error Message: No signature of method: java.util.ArrayList.call() is applicable for argument types...
Fix: 
1. In `build.gradle`, ensure that `dependencies` section does not contain outdated or incompatible libraries.  
   - Upgrade the Android Gradle Plugin if necessary:  
     ```
     ./gradlew dependencies | grep 'com.android.tools.build'
     ```
   - If outdated, update the plugin in `build.gradle`:  
     ```
     dependencies {
         classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.0' // Example version
     }
     ```
   - Run a Gradle sync:  
     ```
     ./gradlew clean build
     ```

## 3. Minimum SDK Version Error  
Error Message: uses-sdk:minSdkVersion (19) cannot be smaller than version (21) declared in AndroidManifest.xml
Fix: 
1. Identify the required `minSdkVersion` from the error message.  
2. Rewrite this line in `AndroidManifest.xml`:  
   ```
   <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="21" />
   ```
3. Run:  
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

## 4. SDK Build Tools Version Error  
Error Message: The SDK Build Tools revision (29.0.2) is too low for project.
Fix: 
1. Install the required SDK version using the SDK Manager:  
   ```
   sdkmanager "build-tools;30.0.3"
   ```
2. Ensure the correct version is referenced in `app/build.gradle`:  
   ```
   android {
       compileSdkVersion 30
       buildToolsVersion "30.0.3"
   }
   ```

## 5. Gradle Wrapper / Java Version Mismatch Error  
Error Message: Could not determine java version from '17.0.14'. (Or Inconsistent JVM-target compatibility)
You must install compatible Java version for project Gradle version.
Fix: 
1. Get gradle version of the project:
   ```
   grep distributionUrl gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties | sed -E 's/.*gradle-([0-9.]+)-.*/\1/'
   ```
   You should capture `5.2` (for example)
2. Check the compatible Java version based on identified Gradle version in below table:
   || Gradle version || Java version ||
   || 2.0~ || 8 ||
   || 5.5~ || 11 ||
   || 7.3~ || 17 ||
   || 8.5~ || 21 ||
   For example, if Gradle version is 5.2, you should install Java 11.
3. Install Java:
   ```
   apt update && apt install -y openjdk-<version>-jdk
   ```
   Try older Java versions upon install failure. If already installed, proceed to next step.
4. **IMPORTANT** Execute this line:
   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=<new_java_path>
   ```

## 6. Gradle Wrapper Doesn't Exist
Error Message: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
Fix: 
1. Install gradle:  
   ```
   sudo apt install gradle
   ```
2. Reinstall the Gradle wrapper and make the script executable:  
   ```
   gradle wrapper && chmod +x gradlew
   ```
NOTE: If gradlew file doesn't exist, then all commands starting with `./gradlew` will fail. Execute `gradle` commands instead.

## 7. Target Platform Not Found Error  
Error Message: failed to find target with hash string 'android-30'
Fix: 
1. Install the missing platform using SDK Manager:  
   ```
   sdkmanager "platforms;android-30"
   ```
2. Rebuild the project:  
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## 8. Build Tools Revision Not Found  
Error Message: failed to find Build Tools revision 30.0.2
Fix: 
1. Install the missing build tools:  
   ```
   sdkmanager "build-tools;30.0.2"
   ```
2. Verify installation:  
   ```
   ls $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/
   ```
3. Clean and rebuild:  
   ```
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

## 9. NDK Toolchain Error  
Error Message: NDK toolchains folder not found.
Fix: 
1. Install the required NDK version:  
   ```
   sdkmanager "ndk;21.3.6528147"
   ```
2. Verify NDK path in `local.properties`:  
   ```
   echo "ndk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/21.3.6528147" >> local.properties
   ```
3. Rebuild:  
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## 10. User-Restricted Install Error  
Error Message: INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED
Fix: 
1. Enable app installation via ADB:  
   ```
   adb shell settings put global package_verifier_enable 1
   ```
2. Reinstall the APK:  
   ```
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

## 11. Invalid NDK Configuration  
Error Message: NDK not found in local.properties.
Fix: 
1. Copy a valid `local.properties` file:  
   ```
   cp ~/.android/local.properties ./local.properties
   ```
2. If necessary, update the NDK path:  
   ```
   echo "ndk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/21.3.6528147" >> local.properties
   ```
3. Rebuild:  
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## 12. Gradle Distribution Checksum Mismatch
Error message: Verification of Gradle distribution failed! Your Gradle distribution may have been tampered with.
Fix:
1. Delete the checksum line in `gradle-wrapper.properties`:
   ```
   distributionSha256Sum=<checksum_value>
   ```
2. Do the same for all `gradle-wrapper.properties` file in the working directory since there can be more than one file.

## 13. Google() repository not found
Error message: Could not find method google() for arguments [] on repository container.
NOTE: Google repository is not available if gradle version is lower than 5.4.1. Unless you have met a missing dependency issue, try to keep the gradle version.
Fix:
1. The line `google()` in `build.gradle`.
   ```
    repositories {
         // google() <- REMOVE
         mavenCentral()
    }
    ```
   
2. Update gradle wrapper by setting `gradle-wrapper.properties` file to:
   ```
   distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.4.1-all.zip
   ```
   or higher.


## Final Notes  
- IMPORTANT: If `gradlew not found` or unknown error happens when executing Gradle commands, use `find . -name gradlew` command to locate gradlew. Make sure that your working directory is the folder with the gradlew file every command.
- If you're not sure which error or the same error persists for a while, then check logs using:  
  ```
  ./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace -q
  ```
- Use `--refresh-dependencies` if dependencies are outdated:  
  ```
  ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
  ```
- **After you try the solutions above, always clean & retry the build**:  
  ```
  ./gradlew --stop
  ./gradlew clean
  ./gradlew assembleDebug
  ```
- Avoid using git clone to start since the directory is already cloned, unless you meet many errors and need to reset the environment.
- If BUILD SUCCESS but the output says Gradle used deprecated features, ignore the warning and check if the .apk file is generated. Your primary goal is to generate the .apk file.
- When using linux commands, always use bash compatible commands.
- Use `find . -name *.apk` to check output .apk file.
- Gradle version 2.3.1 is not available in Google() or mavenCentral() repositories. Upgrade to 3.0.1.
- Empty output does not necessarily mean command failure. For example, `export` or `chmod` commands do not output anything, so you can continue.
- Some projects explicitly state required dependencies and environment versions in `README.md`. If build fails, read the `README.md` file to look for the cause of failure.
- Command `goals_accomplished` is used only for build success. Do not use the command until you have built a working .apk file. DO NOT call this command on build failures. Instead, attempt different kinds of approaches to the problem.
- Avoid interactive prompts at all costs. Use specific non-interactive flags instead.
