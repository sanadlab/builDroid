"""ai_goals:
- Create a Persistent Base Image: You should create a base image with the base dockerfile, then apply and test Docker commands inside the running container.
- Track Successful Commands: You must determine and notify if the previous command was successful, so that every successful command is stored in a log.
- Rollback on Failure: If a command fails, the container reverts to the last working state.
- Generate the Final Dockerfile: Once the build succeeds, all logged successful commands should be merged into a clean final Dockerfile. Then you return the file 'Dockerfile.final'.
