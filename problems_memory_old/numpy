Feedback from previous attempts
- Verify Cloning Process: After cloning the NumPy repository, ensure to check for successful cloning by verifying the presence of expected files. If the directory appears empty, consider re-cloning while closely monitoring the output for errors.

- Check Environment Activation: After activating the virtual environment, use the command which python or which pip to confirm that the commands point to the virtual environment's binaries. This will help ensure the environment is active.

- Install Dependencies Individually: To identify specific issues during the installation process, try installing each dependency from the requirements files one at a time rather than using the combined command.

- Output Handling: Use commands like echo "Message" or ls -la after critical steps (e.g., cloning, activating the environment) to provide clear feedback on the success or failure of those steps.

- Check for Installed Tools: After attempting to install any tool (like spin), check for its availability immediately, and consider including the installation commands for spin in your setup script to avoid missing it in the environment.

- Revisit Dependency Files: Double-check the contents of the build_requirements.txt and test_requirements.txt to ensure no essential dependencies were overlooked.
