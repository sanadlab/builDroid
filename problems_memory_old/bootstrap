Feedback from previous attempts:
- This project requires at least node with version 18

- Install Essential Tools: Include curl and git in the initial setup of the Dockerfile to avoid issues with fetching updates and cloning repositories.

- Set Up for Headless Testing: When configuring the Docker container, consider using a complete headless browser setup or Docker images optimized for testing environments (like selenium/standalone-chrome).

- Modify Karma Configuration Early: Before running tests, ensure the karma.conf.js includes options for headless testing and the --no-sandbox flag for Chromium to prevent compatibility issues.

- Consider Testing in Non-root Environment: If possible, run the tests in a non-root user context to avoid sandboxing issues with Chromium.
