Feedback from previous attempts
- Verify Project Files and Structure: Before proceeding, confirm project requirements by ensuring the existence of a README, Makefile, or similar documentation. This will help clarify if the project needs Python or Node.js setup and prevent unnecessary environment configurations.

- Avoid Redundant Directory Navigation: Validate directory contents once and take note of essential files or configurations to reduce repeated checks.

- Install Dependencies in Sequence:

    For sccache, download the binary directly from a trusted source if apt-get or Cargo fails, as network restrictions may prevent Rust installation.
    If Rust is essential, consider troubleshooting by checking network configurations or permissions that could be blocking rustup.

- Use a docker image that already contains essential modules and utilities for this project
