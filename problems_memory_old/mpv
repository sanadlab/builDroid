Feedback from previous attempts:
- Meson Version: The initial Meson version (0.53.2) was outdated, requiring an upgrade to version >= 1.3.0.
- Python and Pip Absence: Pip was missing, blocking the Meson upgrade.
- libavcodec Version Compatibility: The installed libavcodec-dev version (58.54.100) did not meet the project's requirement (>= 60.31.102).

Recommendations for Next Attempt:

- Base Image Update: Use a newer base image, such as ubuntu:22.04 or later, where dependencies like Meson and FFmpeg may be more current.
- Direct Meson Installation via Pip: Instead of relying on package sources, install the latest Meson directly using pip after installing python3-pip.
- Alternative FFmpeg Source: If libavcodec compatibility issues persist, consider using a pre-built FFmpeg package compatible with the project's requirements, or directly compile FFmpeg from source with the required version.
- Root Access is already available within default user inside docker container (no need to use sudo)
