# buildAnaDroid

> ⚡ Clone, build, and generate debugging APKs for Android projects using LLM-powered automation.

**buildAnaDroid** is a Python package that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically clone any Android project hosted on GitHub, configure it, and **build the debugging `.apk`** file. This enables faster evaluation, performance testing, reverse engineering, or security analysis of Android applications. The building process happens in an isolated Docker container.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Clone any Android GitHub repository.
- ⚙️ Auto-configure Gradle build for debugging.
- 🤖 LLM-guided build troubleshooting and error recovery.
- 📦 Outputs ready-to-install **debugging APK**.
- 🧪 Supports workflows for performance evaluation and static/dynamic analysis.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install build-anadroid
```

## 📦 Dev Container Setup  

To setup in a VSCode Dev Container:  
1. Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.  
2. Clone this repository. 
3. Open the repository in VSCode, and it will prompt you to reopen in the dev container. Alternatively, use a command to open the current folder in a dev container.

## ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Git installed and accessible from terminal
* OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider) for LLM access.

## ⚙️ LLM Configuration

`buildAnaDroid` uses an LLM backend for build assistance. To use it:

1. Obtain your API key from OpenAI or compatible provider.
2. Set your API key as a token file:

```openai_token.txt
"your-api-key-here"
"your-base-url-here"
"your-llm-model-here"
```

`Base url` and `LLM model` are optional. If not provided, `buildAnaDroid` will use OpenAI's `gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14`.
For example, if you put 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/' as your base url, `buildAnaDroid` will access Google AI's `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`.
If you want to use other providers, you have to provide the base url and the LLM model in `openai_token.txt`.

## 🖥️ Usage

### CLI Usage

```bash
build-anadroid build https://github.com/user/project # Run on a single repository
build-anadroid build repos.txt # Run on a list of repositories from a file
```
```bash
build-anadroid clean # Clean test results
```

### Advanced Options for Builds

* `-n`, `--num`: Specify cycle limit (max. number of commands to execute)
* `-c`, `--conv`: Enable conversation mode
* `-k`, `--keep-container`: Keep container after build (Removes container by default)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If the build fails, `buildAnaDroid` will attempt to:

1. Analyze the error output.
2. Query the LLM for common solutions.
3. Retry the build with suggested fixes.

> ❗ **Note:** Some complex/outdated builds may still require manual intervention.
